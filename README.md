Format: ![This is screenshot of my project]

## Description
The motivation for creating this project is two-fold.  As employee with access to sensitive data
I want to randomly generate a password that meets reduces vunerabilityto me as well as my organization.  
This app will allow me to create a strong password that provides greater security not only for me but perhaps for many others within my organization.  

Additoinally, this project provides an opportunity to display my coding skills while they continued to evolve.  

During this project I worked with JavaScript and setting alerts, prompts and eventviewers.  I also worked with creating arrays, strings, loops and the console within Google Development tools. 

Prior to this project I had absolutely no experience in any of these areas. I can definitely say that this has been the most challenging project to date.  I had the most difficulty with calling data stored in the arrays and linking that data together to generate a password that meet all of the critera.

Moving forward, I've identified a couple areas of study that I should spend a bit more time understanding.  Particularly, I need to better understand how to call data that is stored in arrays.
